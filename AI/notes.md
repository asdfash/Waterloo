# 4 Approaches to AI 
## 1. Cognitive modelling  
Systems that think like humans

## 2. Laws of thought  
Systems that think rationally

## 3. Turning Test  
Systems that act like humans  
Gives rize to 6 cores of AI:  
- Natural language processing  
- Knowledge representationm  
- machine learning  
- computer vision  
- robotics  

## 4. Rational Agent Approach  
Systems that act rationally
- Aims to achieve 'the right' outcomes

# Why model behaviour?
- Acting rationally is more general than thinking rationally, correct thinking is  only one way to acheive rationally
- When there is no lofically correct thing to do, we still need to take an action
- Sometimes, we do the right thing without thinking
  
# Why use rationality instead of human behaviour?
- Rationality is well defined
- Humans often dont act intelligently
- Apply the principles rather than the examples
