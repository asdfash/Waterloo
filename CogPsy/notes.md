Functionalism - The mind is what it does, not what its made of.  


descartes operations of the mind:  
1. sensation
2. imagination  
3. understanding: something more than both
    - the mind can try to imagine it but its only finite  

Hume is a empiricalist  
Humian impressions can be turned into more complex operations  

Hume's changing:  
1. compounding
    - combine 2 objects gold + mountain  = golden mountain
2. Transposing/Transporting
    - Human top + horse bottom = centaur
    (taking o1ut works too btw)
3. Agumenting: one crow becomes an unkindess of crows, or human into giant
4. Diminishing
    - reverse of augmenting

# Functional Description and Causal Role
How does one define a corkscrew?  
Can machines think?  
1. what is a machine?
2. what is thinking?

If we set the bar too high, humans don't think  
But if we set the bar too low, even calculators think

## Alan Turing  
Machine - Computer  
- Practical realization of a "Turing machine"
- A machine that can appy rules to a representation of a problem
