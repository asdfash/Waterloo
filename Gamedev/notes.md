# Week 4 - Values (This is what we looking for in a critical game design)
## What does 'value' mean?
- Negative conotation?
- Implying a insider group?
- Things that group people together
    - Political polarities  

Values are properties of things and states of affairs that we care about and strive to attain.  

## Why study values in games?
Enriches understatnding socialcultural poatters are reflected in norms
Creators have a responsibility to reflect on the values they create
Games have the power to shape work, learning and healthcare

## Concientious Design
1. There are common values
2. Artifacts may embody ethical and political values
3. Steps taken in design have the power to affect nature of those values

Questioning one's own worldview is a good start.  
The same game can embody different values to different ppl.  
- e.g. American football - teamwork vs violence  

Implicit vs explicit values
